Community Documentation

## A Place to Share Knowledge

{button}`Learn More →<https://2i2c.org/platform/>`

Every community has its own story, and 2i2c believe that deploying a place to share knowledge adjacent to the place that it is created is a fundamental part of facilitating that story.

> Interactive computing hubs provide access to standardized workflows that make it easier for community members to teach and share with one another, and to enhance their work together.
